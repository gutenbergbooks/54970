<h3><i>About This Book</i></h3>
<p>Here is the story of the plants and animals of the
Everglades, this country&rsquo;s subtropical kingdom. Plants
and animals found nowhere else in the 50 states are
found here in abundance, though in an increasingly
perilous state. In this handbook, first published in 1972,
author and researcher Jean Craighead George brings
to the telling of this story long years of study and
understanding. Checklists and glossaries at the back
buttress her account of the natural history of this
national park.</p>
<p>National Park Handbooks, compact introductions to the
great natural and historic places administered by the
National Park Service, are published to support the
National Park Service&rsquo;s management programs at the
parks and to promote understanding and enjoyment of
the parks. Each is intended to be informative reading
and a useful guide before, during, and after a park visit.
More than 100 titles are in print. This is Handbook
143. You may purchase the handbooks through the
mail by writing to Superintendent of Documents, U.S.
Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402.</p>

subtropical skies. In a vast, shallow sheet this lazy
river idles through tall grasses and shadowy forests,
easing over alligator holes and under bird rookeries,
finally mingling with the salty waters of Florida Bay
and the Gulf of Mexico in the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mangrove">mangrove</a> <a class="gloss" href="#g_Swamp">swamps</a>.
From source to sea, all across the shallow breadth of
this watery landscape, life abounds.</p>
<p><a class="gloss" href="#g_Everglade">Everglades</a> National Park is to most Americans an
Eden where birds, mammals, reptiles, and orchids
find sanctuary. Sunshine sparkles on <a class="gloss" href="#g_Slough">sloughs</a>
teeming with fish, and on <a class="gloss" href="#g_Marsh">marshes</a> where wildflowers
bloom the year around; it shines on tree islands
where birds roost and deer bed down. In this
semitropical garden of plant-and-animal
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Community">communities</a>, every breeze-touched glade, every
cluster of trees is a separate world in which are
tucked yet smaller worlds of such complexity that
even ecologists have not learned all their intricate
relationships.</p>
<p>This book has been written to help you see how the
many pieces of this <a class="gloss" href="#g_Ecology">ecological</a> puzzle fit together
to form a complex, ever-changing, closely woven
web of plants, animals, rock, soil, sun, water, and air.</p>

<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">AMERICA&rsquo;S SUBTROPICAL WONDERLAND</span></h2>
<p><a class="gloss" href="#g_Everglade">Everglades</a> may not be our largest national park
(that honor belongs to Wrangell-St. Elias in
Alaska), but it is certainly the wettest. During and
after the rainy season, when not only the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mangrove">mangrove</a>
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Swamp">swamp</a> but also the sawgrass prairie is under water,
most of the park abounds in fish and other water
life, and even the white-tailed deer leads a semi-aquatic
existence.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that it is low, flat, and largely under
water, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Everglade">Everglades</a> is a park of many environments:
shallow, key-dotted Florida Bay; the coastal
prairie; the vast <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mangrove">mangrove</a> forest and its mysterious
waterways; cypress <a class="gloss" href="#g_Swamp">swamps</a>; the true everglades&mdash;an
extensive freshwater <a class="gloss" href="#g_Marsh">marsh</a> dotted with tree islands
and occasional ponds; and the driest zone,
the pine-and-hammock rockland.</p>
<p>The watery expanse we call &ldquo;<a class="gloss" href="#g_Everglade">everglades</a>,&rdquo; from
which the park gets its name, lies only partly within
the park boundaries. Originally this river flowed,
unobstructed though very slowly, southward from
Lake Okeechobee more than 100 miles to Florida
Bay. It is hardly recognizable as a river, for it is
50 miles wide and averages only about 6 inches
deep, and it creeps rather than flows. Its source,
the area around Lake Okeechobee, is only about
15 feet above sea level, and the riverbed slopes
southward only 2 or 3 inches to the mile.</p>
<p>As you can see by the maps on pages <a class="pgref" href="#Page_2">2</a> and <a class="pgref" href="#Page_3">3</a>,
the works of man have greatly altered the drainage
patterns and the natural values of south
Florida, and you can imagine how this has affected
the supply of water&mdash;the park&rsquo;s lifeblood.</p>
<p>The park&rsquo;s array of plants and animals is a blend of
tropical species, most of which made their way
across the water from the Caribbean islands, and
species from the Temperate Zone, which embraces
all of Florida. All of these inhabitants exist here
through adaptation to the region&rsquo;s peculiar cycles
of flood, drought, and fire and by virtue of subtle
variations in temperature, altitude, and soil.</p>

<p>Underlying the entire park is porous <a class="gloss" href="#g_Limestone">limestone</a>
(<i>see</i> glossary), which was deposited ages ago in
warm seas that covered the southern part of today&rsquo;s
Florida peninsula. Over this limestone only a thin
mantle of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Marl">marl</a> and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Peat">peat</a> provides soil for rooting
plants.</p>
<p>Some of the park&rsquo;s <a class="gloss" href="#g_Ecology">ecosystems</a> (<i>see</i> glossary) are
extremely complex. For example, a single jungle
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Hammock">hammock</a> of a dozen acres may contain, along
with giant live oaks and other plants from the
Temperate Zone, many kinds of tropical <a class="gloss" href="#g_HardwoodTrees">hardwood trees</a>;
a profusion of vines, mosses, ferns, orchids,
and air plants; and a great variety of vertebrate and
invertebrate animals, from tree snails to the

<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<h3 id="c3"><b>Pine Rockland</b></h3>
<p>Entering the park from the northeast, you are on a
road traversing the pineland-and-hammock &ldquo;ridge.&rdquo;
This elevated part of the South Florida <a class="gloss" href="#g_Limestone">limestone</a>
bedrock, which at the park entrance is about 6 feet
above sea level, is the driest zone in the park.
Pine trees, which will grow only on ground that
remains above water most of the year, thrive on
this rockland.</p>
<p>There is another condition essential to the survival
of the pine forest in this region&mdash;fire. We usually
think of fire as the enemy of forest vegetation; but
that is not true here. The pines that grow in this
part of Florida have a natural resistance to fire. Their
thick, corky bark insulates their trunks from the
flames. And strangely enough the fire actually
seems to help with pine reproduction; it destroys
competing vegetation and exposes the mineral soil
seedlings need. If there has been a good cone
crop, you will find an abundant growth of pine
seedlings after a fire in the pinelands.</p>
<p>What would happen if the pinelands were protected
from fire? Examine a pine forest where there have
been no recent fires. You will note that there are
many small hardwood (broadleaved) trees growing
in the shade of the pines. These hardwoods would
eventually shade out the light-demanding pine
seedlings, and take over as the old pines died off.
But under normal conditions, lightning-caused fires
sweep at fairly frequent intervals through the
pineland. Since the hardwoods have little resistance
to fire, they are pruned back.</p>
<p>Before this century, fires burned vast areas. The
only barriers were natural waterways&mdash;<a class="gloss" href="#g_Slough">sloughs</a>,
lakes and ponds, and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Estuary">estuaries</a>&mdash;which retained
some water during the rainless season when the rest
of the glades and pinelands dried up. Old-timers
say that sometimes a fire would travel all the way
from Lake Okeechobee to the coastal prairie of
Cape Sable (<i>see</i> <a href="#Page_2">page 2</a>). In the pine forest, any
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
area bypassed by these fires for a lengthy period
developed into a junglelike island of hardwoods.
We call such stands &ldquo;<a class="gloss" href="#g_Hammock">hammocks</a>,&rdquo; whether they
develop in the pine forest or in the open glades.
On the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Limestone">limestone</a> ridge, the hammocks support a
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Community">community</a> of plants and animals strikingly different
from the surrounding pine forests.</p>

<dd>3 COONTIE</dd>
<dd>4 SAW-PALMETTO AFTER FIRE</dd></dl>
<p>With the opening up of south Florida for farming
and industry, man&rsquo;s works&mdash;particularly roads and
canals&mdash;soon crisscrossed the region, forming
barriers to the spread of the fires. Suppression of
fire by farmers, lumbermen, and park managers also
lessened their effect. Thus the hardwoods, which
previously had been held back by fire, tended to
replace the pines. And although the park was
established to preserve a patch of primitive
subtropical America as it was in earlier centuries,
the landscape began to change.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>Continued protection of the park from fire would in
time eliminate the pineland&mdash;a plant <a class="gloss" href="#g_Community">community</a>
that has little chance to survive elsewhere. So, in
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Everglade">Everglades</a> National Park, Smokey Bear must take
a back seat: park rangers deliberately set fires to
help nature maintain the natural scene. Thus, as
you drive down the road to Flamingo, do not be
shocked to discover park rangers burning the
vegetation. The fires are controlled, of course, and
the existing <a class="gloss" href="#g_Hammock">hammocks</a> are not destroyed.</p>
<p>When you visit the park take a close look at the
pinelands <a class="gloss" href="#g_Community">community</a>. Notice, as you walk on the
manmade trail through the pine forest, that the
ground on either side of you is extremely rough.
The <a class="gloss" href="#g_Limestone">limestone</a> bedrock is visible everywhere; what
soil there is has accumulated in the pits and potholes
that riddle the bedrock. The trees, shrubs, grasses,
and other plants are rooted in these pockets of soil.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>The <a class="gloss" href="#g_Limestone">limestone</a> looks rather hazardous to walk on&mdash;and
it is. You must be careful not to break
through a thin shell of rock covering a cavity.
This pitted, honeycombed condition is due to the
fact that the limestone is easily dissolved by acids.
Decaying pine needles, palmetto leaves, and other
dead plant materials produce weak acids that
continually eat away at the rock.</p>
<p>If a fire has passed through the pineland recently,
you may notice that while most of the low-growing
plants have been killed, some, such as the saw-palmetto,
are sending up new green shoots. The
thick, stubby stem of the palmetto lies in a pothole,
with its roots in the soil that has accumulated there;
even in the dry season the pocket in the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Limestone">limestone</a>
remains damp, for water is never very far below the
surface in this region. When fire kills the top of the
plant, the stem and roots survive, and the palmetto,
like the pine, remains a part of the plant <a class="gloss" href="#g_Community">community</a>.</p>
<p>A number of other plants of the south Florida pinelands
have adapted to the conditions of periodic
burning. Coontie (a cycad, from the underground
stems of which the Indians made flour) and moon
vine (a morningglory) are among many you will
see surviving pineland fires severe enough to result
in the death or stunting of the hardwood seedlings
and saplings.</p>
<p>Sometimes we forget that fire&mdash;like water, wind,
and sunlight&mdash;is a natural force that operates with
the others to influence the evolution of plants as
well as to shape the landscape.</p>
<p>The pineland, like other plant <a class="gloss" href="#g_Community">communities</a>, has its
own community of animals. Some of its residents,
such as the cotton mouse, opossum, and raccoon,
are found in other communities of the park, too.</p>
<p>Some of the pineland animals, however&mdash;pine
warbler, reef gecko, and five-lined skink, for example&mdash;are
particularly adapted to this <a class="gloss" href="#g_Environment">environment</a>.
These lovers of sunlight are dependent, like the pine
forest, on the occasional natural or manmade fires
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
that hold back the <a class="gloss" href="#g_HardwoodTrees">hardwood trees</a>.</p>
<p>The pine rockland is quite different from the other
plant-and-animal <a class="gloss" href="#g_Community">communities</a> you will see as
you drive through the park: it is the only ecosystem
you can explore on foot in any season. Other
parts of the park are largely flooded during the
wet season. Elevated boardwalks have been
provided in some of these areas to enable you to
penetrate them a short distance from the road.</p>
<p>As you will see, fire plays an important role in some
of the other <a class="gloss" href="#g_Everglade">Everglades</a> <a class="gloss" href="#g_Community">communities</a>, too.</p>

<p>Beyond the pinelands the road, having descended
some 2 feet from the park entrance, brings you into
the true <a class="gloss" href="#g_Everglade">everglades</a>&mdash;the river of grass, or, as the
Seminoles call it, Pa-Hay-Okee (grassy waters).
To the eye, the glades look like a very flat, grassy
prairie broken by scattered clumps of trees. During
the dry season (winter) it is in fact a prairie&mdash;and
sometimes burns fiercely. The dominant everglades
plant is sawgrass (actually not a grass but a sedge).
The tree islands develop in both high and low spots
of the glades terrain. In this unbelievably flat
country, small differences in elevation&mdash;measured
in inches rather than feet&mdash;cause major differences
in the plantlife: tropical hardwoods on the &ldquo;mesas,&rdquo;
and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Swamp">swamp</a> trees in the potholes.</p>
<p>A spot in the glades where the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Limestone">limestone</a> base is
elevated just 2 feet will be occupied by a small
forest of tropical hardwoods and palms&mdash;a
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
&ldquo;<a class="gloss" href="#g_Hammock">hammock</a>&rdquo; much like those of the pinelands. A
low spot&mdash;just a few inches below the general level
of the limestone base&mdash;will remain wet even in the
relatively rainless winter when the sawgrass
becomes tinder dry. This sloughlike depression
will support a stand of baldcypress, called a
&ldquo;cypress head.&rdquo; Other tree islands, called bayheads
and willow heads, develop in many places where
soil and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Peat">peat</a> accumulate.</p>
<p>Step from the sawgrass glades into one of these
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Hammock">hammocks</a> or heads; you will find yourself in
another world. You cannot know the park until
you have investigated these plant-and-animal
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Community">communities</a> so distinct from the surrounding <a class="gloss" href="#g_Marsh">marsh</a>
yet so much a part of it. As you drive through the
park, look for the trails provided to give you easy
access into the interior of the tree islands.</p>
<p>Also characteristic of the glades are the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Slough">sloughs</a>&mdash;channels
where the glades water, generally a thin,
seemingly motionless sheet, is deeper and has a
noticeable current. The sloughs support a rich
plantlife and attract a variety of animals, particularly
during the dry season when the water level drops
below the shallow glades bottom. Animals that
live in the glades when they are under water must
migrate or <a class="gloss" href="#g_Estivation">estivate</a> (<i>see</i> glossary) if they are to
survive the rainless months. Many migrate to the
sloughs, the best known of which is Taylor Slough,
where the elevated Anhinga Trail enables you to
walk over the water and observe the wildlife.</p>
<p>Fire is an important factor in the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Ecology">ecology</a> of
the tree-island glades, just as it is in the pineland.
Here, too, artificial barriers such as canals and
roads have hindered the spread of natural fires.
There is some evidence that tree islands were
scattered more thinly over the sawgrass prairie a
half-century ago, when a single fire might wipe
out scores of them and destroy much of the bed of
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Peat">peat</a> that provided a foothold for them. A bird&rsquo;s-eye
view of the glades region today shows many tree islands
that have been established in recent
decades. But park rangers are now utilizing
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
controlled fires in the glades as well as in the
pineland. This tends to prevent new tree islands
from taking hold, and thus helps maintain the
natural <a class="gloss" href="#g_Everglade">everglades</a> landscape.</p>
<p>Driving over the glades toward Florida Bay, you
come to a sign reading &ldquo;Rock Reef Pass&mdash;Elevation
3 Feet.&rdquo; The road then traverses the
so-called dwarf cypress forest. The forest is an
open area of scattered, stunted baldcypress growing
where <a class="gloss" href="#g_Marl">marl</a> (which, unlike <a class="gloss" href="#g_Peat">peat</a>, does not burn)
has accumulated in small potholes dissolved in the
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Limestone">limestone</a>. These marl potholes provide a foothold
for the dwarf cypresses in an area that is spotted
with cypress heads containing much larger trees.
Many of the dwarf cypresses are more than 100
years old, while tall cypresses in the heads may be
less than 50 years old. These anomalies can be
attributed to varying soil depths and water levels
and to the effects of fire.</p>
<p>Before you reach the limit of the fresh-water <a class="gloss" href="#g_Marsh">marsh</a>
you will come to a side road leading to Mahogany
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Hammock">Hammock</a>. (A good foot trail makes it easy to
explore this hardwood jungle island.) Just beyond,
you will notice the first red <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mangrove">mangroves</a>. Small and
scattered in this zone, they are a signal that you
are approaching a strikingly different plant-and-animal

<p>The southward-creeping waters of the glades
eventually meet and mingle with the salty waters of
the tidal <a class="gloss" href="#g_Estuary">estuaries</a>. In this transition zone and along
the gulf and Florida Bay coasts a group of trees
that are tolerant of salty conditions, called
&ldquo;<a class="gloss" href="#g_Mangrove">mangroves</a>,&rdquo; form a vast, watery wilderness.
Impenetrable except by boat, it occupies hundreds
of square miles, embracing both the shifting
zone of <a class="gloss" href="#g_BrackishWater">brackish water</a> and the saltier coastal
waters.</p>
<p>Several kinds of trees are loosely called &ldquo;<a class="gloss" href="#g_Mangrove">mangroves</a>.&rdquo;
The water-tolerant red mangrove grows well out
into the mudflats and is easily recognized by its
arching stiltlike roots. Black-mangrove typically
grows at levels covered by high tide but exposed at
low tide, and it is characterized by the root projections
called pneumatophores that stick up out of
the mud like so many stalks of asparagus growing
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
in the shade of the tree. White-mangrove has no
peculiar root structure and grows, generally, farther
from the water, behind the other trees. Sometimes
all three are found in mixed stands.</p>
<p>This <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mangrove">mangrove</a> wilderness, laced by thousands of
miles of estuarine channels (called &ldquo;rivers&rdquo; and
&ldquo;creeks&rdquo;) and broken by numerous bays and
sounds, is extremely productive biologically. The
brackish zone is particularly valuable as a nursery
ground for shrimp. The larvae and young of these
marine crustaceans and of other marine animals
remain in this relatively protected <a class="gloss" href="#g_Environment">environment</a>
until they are large enough to venture into the open
waters beyond the mangroves.</p>

</div>
<p>The shrimp represent a multi-million-dollar industry,
and the sports-fishing business of the area is said to
exceed that by far. Both would suffer if any damage
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
occurred to this ecosystem. The greatest danger
is the alteration in the flow of fresh waters from
the glades and cypress <a class="gloss" href="#g_Swamp">swamps</a> that occurs when
new canals are built and land is drained for cultivation
or development. The flow carries with it
into the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Estuary">estuaries</a> organic materials from the rich
glades ecosystem; these supplement the vast
quantities of organic matter derived from the decay
of red <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mangrove">mangrove</a> leaves. Thus, a reduction in the
amount of nutrient-laden fresh water flowing into
the mangrove region will affect the welfare of the
ecosystem, and indirectly the livelihood or recreation
of many persons.</p>
<p>The productive zone of <a class="gloss" href="#g_BrackishWater">brackish water</a> varies in
breadth according to the flow of fresh water. In the
wet summer it moves seaward as the flow of fresh
water from the glades pushes the tides back. In the
drier winter the bay and gulf waters move inland
and the brackish zone is quite narrow. The drainage
and canal-building operations in south Florida
can be extremely disruptive here, since too little, or
too much, fresh water flowing into the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Estuary">estuaries</a>
can interfere with their productivity.</p>
<p>Natural disasters such as hurricanes can also bring
about great changes in the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mangrove">mangrove</a> ecosystem.
Yet biologists do not necessarily view the destruction
of mangroves by hurricanes as catastrophic.
The hurricanes have been occurring as long as the
mangroves have grown here and are part of the
complex of natural forces making the region what
it is.</p>
<p>Fire does not seem to be a problem in the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mangrove">mangrove</a>
wilderness. The trees themselves are not
especially fire-resistant, but it is not uncommon to
see a glades fire burn to the edge of the mangroves
and stop when it runs out of fine fuel.</p>
<p class="tb">The <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mangrove">mangrove</a> wilderness is a mecca for many park
visitors. Sportsmen take their motorboats into the
bays and rivers to challenge the fighting tarpon.
Bird lovers seek the roosts and rookeries of herons
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
and wood storks. Canoeists, the only ones able to
explore the secret depths, are drawn by the spell of
labyrinthine channels under arching mangrove
branches. Here, in a wilderness still thwarting
man&rsquo;s efforts at destruction, one experiences a
feeling of utter isolation from the machine world.</p>
<p>But the relentlessly rising sea of the past 10,000
years has belittled drought, fire, hurricane, and
frost as it slowly inundated this land 3 inches each
hundred years. In compensation, the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mangrove">mangrove</a>
forest adds <a class="gloss" href="#g_Peat">peat</a> and rises with the sea. The
sawgrass <a class="gloss" href="#g_Marsh">marshes</a> retreat, and the mangrove ecosystem
prevails essentially unchanged.</p>

<h3 id="c6">Florida Bay and the Coastal Prairie</h3>
<p>When you reach Flamingo, a former fishing village
and now a center for visitor services and accommodations,
you will be on the shore of Florida Bay.
Here is an <a class="gloss" href="#g_Environment">environment</a> rich in variety of animal
life, where porpoises play, the American crocodile
makes its last stand, and the great white heron, once
feared doomed to extinction, holds its own. The
abundance of game fish in the bay has given it a
reputation as one of the best sport-fishing grounds
on the east coast.</p>
<p>The bay&rsquo;s approximately 100 <a class="gloss" href="#g_Key">keys</a> (low-lying islets)
were built up by <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mangrove">mangroves</a> and provide foothold
for other plants hardy enough to withstand the
salty <a class="gloss" href="#g_Environment">environment</a> and the sometimes violent winds.
The keys are also a breeding ground for water
birds, ospreys, and bald eagles.</p>
<p>Florida Bay, larger than some of our States, is so
shallow that at low tide some of it is out of water;
its greatest depth is about 9 feet. The shallows and
mudflats attract great numbers of wading birds,
which feed upon the abundant life sheltered in the
seaweeds&mdash;a plant-and-animal <a class="gloss" href="#g_Community">community</a> nourished
by nutrients carried in the waters flowing
from the glades and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mangrove">mangroves</a>.</p>
<p>To the west beyond Flamingo is Cape Sable.
This near-island includes the finest of the
park&rsquo;s beaches and much of the coastal prairie
ecosystem. A fringe of coconut palms along the
beach could be the remnants of early attempts at a
plantation on the cape that did not survive the
hurricanes; or it could be the result of the sprouting
of coconuts carried by currents from Caribbean
plantations and washed up on the cape. For a
time, casuarina trees (called &ldquo;Australian pines&rdquo;),
which became established on Cape Sable after
Hurricane Donna, seemed to threaten the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Ecology">ecology</a>
of the beach. But these invaders were mostly removed
in 1971, and now appear to be under control.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>Examine the &ldquo;sand&rdquo; of this beach. You will
discover that it is not quartz grains&mdash;but mostly
minute shell fragments. Entire shells of the warm-water
molluscs that live offshore also wash up on
the beach. There are also artifacts that speak of
Indian activity in this area in past centuries,
curled centers of conch shells from which the
pre-Columbian Indians fashioned tools, and
numerous pieces of pottery (potsherds). Both
shells and potsherds tempt the collector. Shelling&mdash;that
is, the collecting of <i>dead</i> shells, for noncommercial
purposes&mdash;is permitted. But Federal
law prohibits the removal of even a fragment of
pottery&mdash;for these are invaluable Indian relics,
essential to continuing scientific investigation of
the human history of the region.</p>

<p>Back from the narrow beach is a drier zone of
grasses and other low-growing vegetation. Some
of the plants of this zone, such as the railroad vine,
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
are so salt-tolerant that in places they grow almost
to the water&rsquo;s edge. (No plant that is extremely
sensitive to salty soil could survive on Cape Sable.)
Beyond the grassy zone is a zone of hardwoods
(buttonwood, gumbo-limbo, Jamaica dogwood),
cactuses, yucca, and other plants forming a
transition from beach to coastal prairie.</p>
<p>Birds provide much of the visual excitement of the
beach <a class="gloss" href="#g_Community">community</a>, just as they do in other parts of
the park. Sandpipers, pelicans, gulls, egrets,
ospreys, and bald eagles use it and the bordering
waters for feeding, nesting, and resting. Mammals,
notably raccoons, stalk the beach in search of food.
And the big loggerhead turtle depends on it for
nesting. In late spring and early summer the female
loggerhead hauls herself up on the beach and digs
a hole above hightide mark. There she deposits
about 100 ping-pong balls&mdash;which should hatch
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
out into baby loggerheads. Unfortunately for this
marine reptile, however, most of them meet another
fate. Hardly has the female turtle covered the eggs
with sand and started back toward the water, than
they are dug up and devoured by raccoons and
other <a class="gloss" href="#g_Predator">predators</a>. These conditions created such
high mortality of the turtles that the National Park
Service has adopted special protective measures&mdash;removing
some of the raccoons and erecting wire
barriers around turtle nests. These measures have
been effective, but continued surveillance is required
if the loggerhead is not to disappear from
Florida.</p>

</div>
<p>An abundance of raccoons and other <a class="gloss" href="#g_Predator">predators</a> is
not the only threat to survival of the loggerhead
turtle. A major factor in its decline is the serious
depletion of its nesting <a class="gloss" href="#g_Habitat">habitat</a>. Park visitors are
prohibited from interfering with these reptiles.
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
Cape Sable beach is today virtually the only wild
beach in South Florida, thanks to its inclusion in
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Everglade">Everglades</a> National Park. At present, visitors can
reach it only by boat. But it would be foolhardy to
take it for granted that the beach will remain
unspoiled. Its potential as an attraction is such that
someone not ecologically aware might believe that
access for motorists would be an improvement.
Roads, however, would bring increased pressure
on the ecosystem by large numbers of visitors, and
demands for further development, for lodging,
meals, and other services seem always to go with
automobiles. With continued protection from such
encroachments, Cape Sable Beach will remain a
unique wilderness resource and will not become
just another recreational facility.</p>
<p>Merging with the beach is the coastal prairie, an
ecosystem supporting red and black <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mangrove">mangroves</a>,
grasses, and other plants tolerant of the very salty
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Environment">environment</a>. Hardwood <a class="gloss" href="#g_Hammock">hammocks</a> have developed
here on Indian shell mounds, but the trees are
stunted by the saline soils. Though there is no lack
of water on the cape, much of the region appears
arid because hurricane-lashed tides have deposited
soils of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Marl">marl</a> and debris so salt-laden that only
sparse vegetation develops.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<h3 id="c7">Big Cypress <a class="gloss" href="#g_Swamp">Swamp</a></h3>
<p>To the west of the great fresh-water <a class="gloss" href="#g_Marsh">marsh</a> called
the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Everglade">everglades</a>, lying almost entirely outside the
park, is an ecosystem vitally linked to the park.
Big Cypress <a class="gloss" href="#g_Swamp">Swamp</a> is a vast, shallow basin that
includes practically all of Collier County. It is
commonly called &ldquo;The Big Cypress&rdquo;&mdash;not because
of the size of its trees, but because of its extent.
Most of the baldcypresses (which are not true
cypresses) are small trees, growing in open to
dense stands throughout the area. The swamp is
watered by about 50 inches of annual rainfall, the
runoff from which flows as a sheet and in <a class="gloss" href="#g_Slough">sloughs</a>
south and west to meet the coastal strip of
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Mangrove">mangroves</a> and low sand dunes.</p>
<p>Big Cypress is speckled with low <a class="gloss" href="#g_Limestone">limestone</a>
outcrops, cut with shallow <a class="gloss" href="#g_Slough">sloughs</a> 1 to 2 feet deep,
and dotted with ponds and wet prairies. As in the
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Everglade">everglades</a>, fire and water maintain the character
of the plantlife in this swampy realm of sunlight
and shadow. Also as in the everglades, a difference
of a few inches in elevation creates different
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Community">communities</a>. Tropical hardwood <a class="gloss" href="#g_Hammock">hammocks</a>
grow on rocky outcrops. In the depressions arise
bayheads and clumps of pond apple, pop ash, and
willow. The larger baldcypress trees grow in
shallow sloughs, which are usually surrounded by
prairies of sawgrass and maiden cane growing on
slightly higher land. Although the several different
plant communities resemble those in the glades,
they support slightly different plants, because of the
sandy soil (there being more quartz in the limestone
under Big Cypress than in the park).</p>
<p>These baldcypresses, many measuring 3 to 6
feet in diameter, were heavily lumbered from 1930
to 1950. Today, few giant trees survive, but a
sizable stand exists on the Norris Tract&mdash;so named
for its conservation-minded donor&mdash;which forms
the nucleus of Corkscrew <a class="gloss" href="#g_Swamp">Swamp</a> Sanctuary.
Here, protected by the National Audubon Society,
are baldcypresses 130 feet tall; some have a girth
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
of 25 feet! A boardwalk more than one-half mile
long enables you to enjoy the beauty of this wild
preserve without getting your feet wet.</p>

<p>The eastern edge of the big <a class="gloss" href="#g_Swamp">swamp</a> and its importance
to <a class="gloss" href="#g_Everglade">Everglades</a> National Park came to
worldwide attention in 1969 when it was selected
as the site for the proposed Miami International
Jetport. According to plans, this was to be the
biggest airport in the world, covering 39 square
miles and handling 65 million passengers a year.
Millions of persons were expected to make their
home in and around the jetport. Such a threat to
the national park, into which the waters of Big
Cypress partly drain, provoked protest letters from
all over the world. Most writers objected on the
grounds that Everglades belongs to all and that a
jetport here would seal the doom of the park.
Congress acted in 1974 by establishing Big Cypress
National Preserve to help protect the water
supply to Everglades National Park.</p>

<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">PLANT-AND-ANIMAL <a class="gloss" href="#g_Community">COMMUNITIES</a></span></h2>
<p>To know <a class="gloss" href="#g_Everglade">Everglades</a>, you must become acquainted
with some of its diverse <a class="gloss" href="#g_Community">communities</a>. The
physical conditions determining the existence of a
particular community may seem subtle&mdash;just a few
inches difference in elevation, or an accumulation
of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Peat">peat</a> in a depression in the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Limestone">limestone</a> bedrock,
for example. But often, the change in your
surroundings as you step from one community to
another is startling&mdash;for it is abrupt and complete.
In Everglades, the dividing line between two
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Habitat">habitats</a> may separate an almost entirely different
association of plants and animals.</p>
<p>Use the trails that have been laid out to help you
see the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Community">communities</a>. They make access easy for
you; the rest is up to you. Be observant: notice
the stemlike root of a saw-palmetto in a damp
pothole of the pineland; look closely at the
periphyton that plays such an important role in the
glades <a class="gloss" href="#g_FoodChain">food chain</a>. Note the difference in feeding
methods of wading birds; each species has its own
niche in the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Habitat">habitat</a>. Most of all, get into the
habit of thinking of each animal, each plant, as a
member of the closely woven web of life that
makes up an integrated community.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<h3 id="c9">Tropical Hardwood <a class="gloss" href="#g_Hammock">Hammock</a></h3>
<p>Generally, in south Florida, hardwood <a class="gloss" href="#g_Hammock">hammocks</a>
develop only in areas protected from fire, flood, and
saline waters. The land must be high enough
(1 to 3 feet above surrounding levels) to stand
above the water that covers the glades much of
the year. The roots of the trees must be out of the
water and must have adequate aeration. In the
park, these conditions prevail on the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Limestone">limestone</a>
&ldquo;ridge&rdquo; (elevation of which ranges from 3 to 7 feet
above sea level) and some spots in the glades
region. On the limestone ridge, in areas bypassed
by fires for a long period, hammocks have developed.
Pines grow in the surrounding areas, where
repeated fires have held back the hardwoods.</p>
<p>The moats that tend to form around glades
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Hammock">hammocks</a>, as acids from decaying plant materials
dissolve the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Limestone">limestone</a>, hold water even during the
dry season; the moats thus act as barriers protecting
the hammock vegetation from glades fires.</p>
<p>When the white man took over southern Florida,
these <a class="gloss" href="#g_Hammock">hammocks</a> were luxuriant jungle islands
dominated by towering tropical hardwoods and
palms. Stumps and logs on the floors of some of the
remaining hammocks, attesting to the enormous
size of some of the earlier trees, are sad reminders
of the former grandeur of the hammocks. While
most of south Florida&rsquo;s hammocks have been
destroyed, you can still see some fine ones
protected in the park. At Royal Palm Hammock,
near park headquarters, Gumbo Limbo Trail winds
through a dim, dense forest with welcome coolness
on a hot day.</p>
<p>Stepping into a jungle <a class="gloss" href="#g_Hammock">hammock</a> from either the
sunbathed glades or the open pine forest is a
sudden, dramatic change. The contrast when you
enter Gumbo Limbo Trail immediately after walking
the Anhinga Trail is striking. While the watery
world of Anhinga is dominated by a noisy profusion
of wildlife, the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Environment">environment</a> of Gumbo Limbo will
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
seem to be a mere tangle of vegetation. But the
jungle hammock, too, has its <a class="gloss" href="#g_Community">community</a> of
animals&mdash;even though you may notice none but
mosquitoes. Many of its denizens are nocturnal
in their habits, but if you remain alert you will
observe birds, invertebrates, and perhaps a lizard.</p>

<p>The trees that envelop you as you walk on Gumbo
Limbo Trail are mostly tropical species; of the
dominant trees, only the live oak (which grows as
far north as Virginia) can be considered non-tropical.
Under oaks and tropical bustics, poisonwood,
mastics, and gumbo-limbos grow small trees such
as tetrazygia, rough-leaf velvetseed, and wild
coffee, a multitude of mosses and ferns, and only
a few species of shade-tolerant flowering plants.
Orchids and air plants burst like sun stars from
limbs, trunks, and fallen logs. Twining among them
all, the woody vines called lianas enhance the
jungle atmosphere. Adding a final touch are the
royal palms that here and there tower over the
hardwood canopy&mdash;occasionally reaching 125 feet.</p>

<p>The <a class="gloss" href="#g_Limestone">limestone</a> rock that underlies the entire park is
porous and soluble; consequently the floor of the
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Hammock">hammock</a> is pitted with solution holes dissolved
by the acid from decaying vegetation. Soil and
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Peat">peat</a> accumulating in the water-filled bottom of one
of these holes supports a plant <a class="gloss" href="#g_Community">community</a> of its
own: perhaps a pond apple, surrounded by ferns
and mosses (including some varieties that seem to
be limited to this pothole <a class="gloss" href="#g_Environment">environment</a>).</p>
<p>A dead, decaying log on the ground may support
another miniature plant <a class="gloss" href="#g_Community">community</a>&mdash;a carpet of
mosses, ferns, and other small plants that thrive
in such moist situations.</p>
<p>Strangest of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Hammock">hammock</a> plants is the strangler
fig, which first gets a foothold in the rough bark of
a live oak, cabbage palm, or other tree. It then
sends roots down to the ground, entwining about
the host tree as it grows, and eventually killing it.
On the Gumbo Limbo Trail you will see a strangler
fig that grew in this manner and was enmeshed by
another strangler fig&mdash;which now is <a class="gloss" href="#g_Threatened">threatened</a> by
a third fig that already has gained a foothold in
its branches.</p>
<p>Best known of the glades <a class="gloss" href="#g_Hammock">hammocks</a> is Mahogany
Hammock. A boardwalk trail in this lush, junglelike
<a class="gloss" href="#g_TreeIsland">tree island</a> leads past the giant mahogany tree for
which the hammock was named&mdash;now, because of
Hurricane Donna, a dismembered giant. This fine
tree island was explored only after the park was
established.</p>
<p>An array of large and small vertebrate animals,
mostly representative of the Temperate Zone, populates
these tropical hardwood jungles: raccoons
and opossums, many varieties of birds, snakes and
lizards, tree frogs, even bobcats and the rare
Florida panther, or cougar. Not surprisingly, invertebrates&mdash;including
insects and snails&mdash;abound
in this luxuriant plant <a class="gloss" href="#g_Community">community</a>. The tropical
influence is evident in the presence of invertebrates
such as tree snails of the genus <i>Liguus</i>, known
outside of Florida only in Hispaniola and Cuba.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<h3 id="c10">Cypress Head</h3>
<p>Standing out conspicuously on the glades
landscape are tall, domelike tree islands of
baldcypress. Unlike <a class="gloss" href="#g_Hammock">hammocks</a>, which occupy
elevations, cypress heads, or domes, occupy
depressions in the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Limestone">limestone</a> bedrock&mdash;areas that
remain as ponds or wet places during seasons when
the glades dry up. Water-loving cypresses need
only a thin accumulation of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Peat">peat</a> and soil to begin
their growth in these depressions or in smaller
solution holes in the limestone.</p>

<p class="pcap">TURKEY VULTURE</p>
</div>
<p>Though most conifers retain their needles all year,
baldcypresses shed their foliage in winter. The
fallen needles decay, forming acids that dissolve the
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Limestone">limestone</a> further; thus these trees tend to enlarge
their own ponds. Since the pond is deeper in the
middle, and the accumulation of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Peat">peat</a> is greater
there, the taller trees grow in the center of the head,
with the smaller ones toward the edge. Hence the
characteristic dome-shaped profile.</p>
<p>Usually when fire sweeps the glades, the baldcypresses,
occupying low, wet spots, are not
injured. But with extended drought, the water
disappears and the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Peat">peat</a> may burn for months,
killing all the baldcypresses.</p>
<p>The cypress heads sometimes serve as alligator
holes, where the big reptiles and other aquatic
animals are able to survive dry periods. As you
drive along the park road, stop and examine these
tree islands through your binoculars; they are
favored haunts of many of the park&rsquo;s larger wading
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
birds. Look for herons, egrets, wood storks, and
white ibis, which visit these swampy <a class="gloss" href="#g_Habitat">habitats</a> to

<p>Many of the tree islands in the fresh-water glades
are of the type called bayhead. Growing in depressions
in the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Limestone">limestone</a> or from beds of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Peat">peat</a>
built up on the bedrock, these plant <a class="gloss" href="#g_Community">communities</a>
contain a variety of trees, including <a class="gloss" href="#g_Swamp">swamp</a> holly,
redbay, sweetbay, wax myrtle, and cocoplum.
Some of them, on the fringes of the brackish zone,
are marked by clumps of graceful paurotis palms
growing at their edges.</p>
<p>Like the hardwood <a class="gloss" href="#g_Hammock">hammocks</a> in the pinelands,
bayheads are prevented from taking over the entire
glades ecosystem by the dry-season fires that
sweep the region at irregular intervals. The fires
do not always affect the bayheads. A moat,
formed by the dissolving action of acids from
decaying plant materials on the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Limestone">limestone</a>, may
surround the <a class="gloss" href="#g_TreeIsland">tree island</a>, providing some protection
from fire. Wildlife concentrates in these moats
during the dry season. Birds congregate here to
harvest the fish, snails, and other aquatic life&mdash;and
occasionally themselves fall prey to lurking
alligators.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<h3 id="c12">Willow Head</h3>
<p>Willows pioneer new territories and create an
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Environment">environment</a> that enables other plants to gain a
foothold. Their windblown seeds usually root in
sunny land opened by fire and agriculture. Since
these trees require a great quantity of water, the
solution holes in the glades are favorable sites.
Seedlings grow, leaves fall, and stems and twigs
die and drop&mdash;contributing to the formation of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Peat">peat</a>.
When this builds up close to or above the surface
of the water, it provides a <a class="gloss" href="#g_Habitat">habitat</a> for other trees
such as sweet bay and cocoplum; with enough of
these the willow head changes character and
becomes a bayhead.</p>
<p>Years ago, when alligators were plentiful, they
weeded the willow-bordered solution holes, keeping
them open. Consequently, the willow heads were
typically donut-shaped. Today, however, alligators
are scarce and many of the willow heads have no
&rsquo;gators. The solution holes fill with muck and
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Peat">peat</a>; relatively tall willows rise out of the deep,
peat-filled centers, with increasingly smaller ones
toward the less fertile edges, and the willow heads
take on the characteristic dome-shaped profile but
not nearly the height of the cypress domes. They
have a clumpy, brushy appearance, seeming to grow
right out of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Marsh">marsh</a> without trunks.</p>

<p>Willow heads that do have alligator holes have a
seasonal concentration of aquatic animals and the
birds and mammals that prey upon them. They
rarely support orchids or <a class="gloss" href="#g_Bromeliad">bromeliads</a>, for the bark
of the southern willow is too smooth to provide
anchorage for the seedlings of these plants.</p>
<p>During drought periods willow heads, like bayheads,
are vulnerable to the fires that sometimes burn
over the glades.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<h3 id="c13">Web of Life in the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Marsh">Marsh</a></h3>
<p>Around the stems and other underwater parts of the
glades plants are cylindrical masses of yellowish-green
<i>periphyton</i>. So incredibly abundant are
these masses of living material that in late summer
the water appears as though clogged with mossy-looking
sausages and floating pancakes. Largely
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Algae">algae</a>, but containing perhaps 100 different
organisms, the periphyton supports a complex web
of glades life. It is the beginning of many food chains
in the fresh-water <a class="gloss" href="#g_Marsh">marsh</a>. The larvae of
mosquitoes and other invertebrates, larval frogs
(tadpoles) and salamanders, and other small,
free-swimming creatures feed upon the tiny plants
and minute animals living in the masses of periphyton.
These periphyton feeders are in turn
fed upon by small fish, frogs, and other vertebrates,
which are food for big fish, birds, mammals, and
reptiles; most of these larger creatures are preyed
upon by the alligator.</p>
<p>The periphyton is perhaps most important for its
role in maintaining the physical <a class="gloss" href="#g_Environment">environment</a> of the
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Marsh">marsh</a>. The water flowing over the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Limestone">limestone</a> of
the glades is hard with calcium. The <a class="gloss" href="#g_Algae">algae</a> remove
this calcium and convert it to <a class="gloss" href="#g_Marl">marl</a> (<i>see</i> glossary),
which precipitates to the bottom. Sawgrass is
rooted in this marl; accumulated dead sawgrass
forms <a class="gloss" href="#g_Peat">peat</a>; other marsh plants, including willows
and the trees of the bayheads, spring up from the
peat. Acid from the peat and from decaying plant
matter of the tree islands dissolves some of the marl
and underlying bedrock&mdash;and the cycle is complete.</p>
<p>Every plant, every animal, every physical element
is involved in this web of life&mdash;as soil builder,
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Predator">predator</a>, plant-eater, scavenger, agent of decay,
or converter of energy and raw materials into food.
Damage to or removal of any of these components&mdash;pollution
of the water, lowering of the water
table, elimination of a predator, or any interference
in the energy cycle&mdash;could destroy the glades as
we know them.</p>

<h3 id="c14">Alligator Hole in the Glades</h3>
<p>Out in the sunny glades the broad leaves of the
alligator flag mark the location of an alligator hole.
This is the most incredible ecosystem of all the
worlds within the world of the park; for in a sense
the alligator is the keeper of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Everglade">everglades</a>.</p>
<p>With feet and snout these reptiles clear out the
vegetation and muck from the larger holes in the
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Limestone">limestone</a>. In the dry season, when the floor of the
glades checks in the sun, these holes are oases.
Then large numbers of fish, turtles, snails, and
other fresh-water animals take refuge in the holes,
moving right in with the alligators. Enough of
these water-dependent creatures thus survive the
drought to repopulate the glades when the rains
return. Birds and mammals join the migration
of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Everglade">everglades</a> animal kingdom to the alligator
holes, feed upon the concentrated life in them&mdash;and
in turn occasionally become food for their alligator
hosts.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig28">

<p class="pcap">ALLIGATOR FLAG</p>
</div>
<p>Lily pads float on the surface. Around the edges
arrowleaf, cattails, and other emergent plants grow.
Behind them on higher muckland, much of which
is created by the alligators as they pile up plant
debris, stand ferns, wildflowers, and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Swamp">swamp</a> trees.
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Algae">Algae</a> thrive in the water. The rooted water plants
might become so dense as to hinder the movement
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
and growth of the fish, were it not for the weeding
activities of the alligators. With the old reptiles
keeping the pool open, the fish thrive, and alligator
and guests live well.</p>
<p>Plants piled beside the hole by the alligator decay
and form soil with mud and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Marl">marl</a>. Ferns, wildflowers,
and tree seedlings take root, and eventually
the alligator hole may be the center of a <a class="gloss" href="#g_TreeIsland">tree island</a>.</p>
<p>So, it&rsquo;s easy to see how important the alligator is to
the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Ecology">ecology</a> of the park. Unfortunately for this reptile,
many people in the past believed only in the value
of its hide. Hunting for alligators became profitable
in the mid-1880&rsquo;s and continued until the 1960&rsquo;s. In
1961 Florida prohibited all hunting of alligators, but
poaching continued to take its toll. Finally, the Federal
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Endangered">Endangered</a> Species Act of 1969 protected the
alligator by eliminating all hunting and trafficking in
hides.</p>
<p>As a result of complete protection, the alligator has
increased greatly in number. They are no longer an
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Endangered">endangered</a> species in Florida, and they can easily
be found in gator holes and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Slough">sloughs</a>. Today alligators
are eagerly sought by visitors to <a class="gloss" href="#g_Everglade">Everglades</a> National
Park who are anxious to see and photograph this
unique creature. Once again, the alligator is the
keeper of the everglades.</p>

<p><a class="gloss" href="#g_Everglade">Everglades</a> National Park, with its array of plant
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Community">communities</a>&mdash;ranging from the pines and palmettos
rooted in the pitted <a class="gloss" href="#g_Limestone">limestone</a> bedrock of the
park&rsquo;s dry uplands, through the periphyton-based
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Marsh">marsh</a> community and the brackish <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mangrove">mangrove</a>
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Swamp">swamp</a>, to the highly saline waters of Florida
Bay&mdash;is an amateur botanist&rsquo;s paradise. Many
of the park&rsquo;s plants are found nowhere else in the
United States. Only here at the southern tip of the
Florida peninsula do tropical trees and orchids
mingle with oaks and pines.</p>
<p>This book is not intended to be a manual for
identification of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Everglade">Everglades</a> plants. You will
need to arm yourself with appropriate field guides to
ferns, orchids, aquatic plants, trees, or whatever
your special interest may be. The reading list in the
appendix suggests a few.</p>
<p>While the park is a mecca for students of plantlife,
you must keep one thing in mind: your collecting
will be limited to photographs (and, if you&rsquo;re an
artist, drawings). <i>No specimens may be removed
or disturbed.</i> Fortunately, with today&rsquo;s versatile
cameras and high-quality color films you can take
home a complete and accurate record of your
plant discoveries.</p>
<p>Much of our present knowledge of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Everglade">Everglades</a>
plantlife has been garnered by amateurs. Much
more needs to be accumulated before an environmental
management program for the park can be
perfected, and serious students of botany are invited
to make their data available to the park staff.</p>
<p>As for wild animals, one hardly needs to look for
them in this park! Most visitors come here, at least
partly, for that reason. And even those not seeking
wildlife should be alert to avoid stepping on or
running down the slower or less wary creatures.
But animal watching is a great pastime, and it pays
to learn to do it right. A few suggestions may help
you make the most of your experience in <a class="gloss" href="#g_Everglade">Everglades</a>.</p>

<p>A notebook in which to record your observations
will help you discover that this park is not just a
landscape of grass, water, and trees where a lot of
animals happen to live&mdash;but a complex, subtropical
world of plant-and-animal <a class="gloss" href="#g_Community">communities</a>, each
distinct and yet dependent upon the others. To
gain real understanding of this world you will need
certain skills and some good habits. Ability to
identify what you see&mdash;with the help of good field
guides (<i>see</i> <a href="#c25">reading list</a>) and quite a bit of practice&mdash;will
make things easier and much more
enjoyable.</p>
<p>Knowing where to look for the animals helps; this
book and the field guides are useful for this.
You&rsquo;ll find that some species are seen only in certain
parts of the park, while others roam far and wide.
Don&rsquo;t look for the crocodile in the fresh-water
glades&mdash;nor for the round-tailed muskrat in the
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Mangrove">mangroves</a>. On the other hand, don&rsquo;t be surprised
to see the raccoon or its tracks in almost any part
of the park.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that all species in the national parks
are protected by law. Most wild animals are
harmless as long as they are not molested. If you
encounter an animal you aren&rsquo;t sure about, simply
keep out of its way; don&rsquo;t try to harm it or drive
it off. Always remember that each animal is part
of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Everglade">Everglades</a> <a class="gloss" href="#g_Community">community</a>; you cannot disturb
it without affecting everything else.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<h3 id="c16">Air Plants</h3>
<p>Long before you have learned to distinguish the
major plant <a class="gloss" href="#g_Community">communities</a>, you will be aware of the
air plants&mdash;or epiphytes&mdash;that grow so profusely
in <a class="gloss" href="#g_Everglade">Everglades</a>. Epiphytes are non-parasitic plants
that grow on other plants, getting their nourishment
from the air. Best known is Spanish moss, which
festoons the trees of the coastal South from Virginia
to Texas; this plant is used by the swallow-tailed
kite in constructing its beautiful nest. Despite
its name, Spanish moss is actually a member of the
pineapple family&mdash;the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Bromeliad">bromeliads</a>. Bromeliads are
the most conspicuous of the park&rsquo;s air plants. The
epiphytic orchids, though less common, are
celebrated for their beauty; their fame, unfortunately,
has led to their widespread destruction. There are
also epiphytic ferns, trees, and vines; and one
cactus, the mistletoe cactus, has taken to the air.</p>
<p>Air plants are highly specialized for making a living
under crowded conditions; there are more than
2,000 species of plants competing for sun and water
in southern Florida. The epiphytes have adapted
to the problem of space by growing on other plants.
Their roots, although they absorb some water and
minerals, are primarily anchors. Living in an
atmosphere that fluctuates between drought and
humidity, they have evolved several water-conserving
tricks. Some have a reduced number of
leaves; others have tough skins that resist loss of
water through transpiration; still others have thick
stems, called pseudobulbs, that store moisture.
The <a class="gloss" href="#g_Bromeliad">bromeliads</a> are particularly ingenious: many
have leaves shaped in such a way that they hold
rainwater in vaselike reservoirs at their bases.
Mosquitoes and tree frogs breed in these tiny
reservoirs, and in dry periods many arboreal animals
seek the dew that collects here.</p>
<p>Most of the orchids and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Bromeliad">bromeliads</a> grow in the
dimly lit tropical hardwood <a class="gloss" href="#g_Hammock">hammocks</a> and cypress
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Slough">sloughs</a>. A few species, however, having adapted
to the sunlight, live on dwarf <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mangrove">mangroves</a> and the
scattered buttonwoods, pond apples, willows, and
cocoplums of the glades. The butterfly and cowhorn
orchids are sun lovers, as are the twisted,
banded, and stiff-leaved bromeliads. All have
adapted to the sun with dew-condensing mechanisms
or vases at the bottom of the clustered leaves.</p>

<p>One tree, the strangler fig, starts as an epiphytic
seedling on the branches of other trees. Eventually,
however, it drops long aerial roots directly to the
ground or entwines them about the trunk of the
host tree&mdash;which in time dies, leaving a large fig
tree in its place.</p>
<p>Of all <a class="gloss" href="#g_Everglade">Everglades</a> plants, the epiphytic orchids are
most fascinating to man&mdash;a fact which largely
explains their decline. Of some 50,000 species
around the world (the orchids being one of the
largest of plant families), the park has only a few.
Fire, loss of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Habitat">habitat</a> due to agriculture and construction,
and poaching by both commercial and
amateur collectors have brought about the
extermination of some and have made others
exceedingly rare. Some are rare because of special
life requirements. For example, a few must live in
association with a certain fungus that coats their
roots and provides specific nutrients.</p>
<p>The largest orchid in the park is the cowhorn, some
specimens of which weigh as much as 75 pounds.
Unfortunately, this orchid has been a popular item
for orchid growers and collectors and is becoming
rare in Florida. Poachers have practically eliminated
it from the park. In the late 1960s Boy Scout friends
of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Everglade">Everglades</a> salvaged many orchids from <a class="gloss" href="#g_Hammock">hammocks</a>
about to be bulldozed for the jetport. By laboriously
tying them to trees in the park, they assured the survival
of the plants.</p>
<p>The night-blooming epidendrum is perhaps the most
beautiful of the park&rsquo;s orchids. It is widespread
and fairly common in <a class="gloss" href="#g_Everglade">Everglades</a>, occurring in all
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Ecology">ecosystems</a>. Flowering throughout the year, it
bears its white, spiderlike blossoms, 2 inches

<p>Epiphytic orchids have the smallest seeds of any
flowering plants. Dustlike, they travel far and wide
on the air; it is believed that over eons all species of
Florida orchids arrived on the wind from South
America and the West Indies.</p>
<p>The giant wildpine is a spectacular <a class="gloss" href="#g_Bromeliad">bromeliad</a>
that grows on the sturdy limbs of buttonwoods,
spreading to 48 inches and developing a flower
stalk 6 feet long.</p>
<p>Of the approximately 20 species of epiphytic
ferns in the park, the most common is the curious
resurrection fern. Sometimes called the poor man&rsquo;s
barometer, it has leaves that in dry weather curl
under and turn brown but with the coming of rain
quickly unfold and turn bright green, making instant
gardens of the logs, limbs, and branches on which
they grow.</p>
<p>Watch for the air plants (as well as the trees and
other wildflowers) that have been labeled along the
trails and boardwalks. You will be able to examine
some of them closely&mdash;but leave them unharmed
for future visitors!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<h3 id="c17">Mammals</h3>
<p>In the drowned <a class="gloss" href="#g_Habitat">habitats</a> of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Everglade">Everglades</a> it is not
surprising to find water-bound mammals such as
the porpoise; or fish-eating amphibious mammals
such as the otter; or even land mammals, such as
the raccoon, that characteristically feed upon aquatic
life. But to see mammals that one ordinarily does
not associate with water behaving as though they
were born to it is another matter. The white-tailed
deer is an example. It is so much a part of this
watery <a class="gloss" href="#g_Environment">environment</a> that you will most likely observe
it far out in the glades, feeding upon aquatic plants
or bounding over the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Marsh">marsh</a>. Very probably the
deer you see was born on one of the tree islands,
and has never been out of sight of the sawgrass river.</p>
<p>Many other mammals of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Everglade">Everglades</a> are adapted
to a semi-aquatic existence. The park&rsquo;s only
representative of the hare-and-rabbit clan is the
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Marsh">marsh</a> rabbit; smaller than its close relative, the
familiar cottontail of fields and woodlands, it is as
comfortable in this wet world as if it had webbed
feet. So don&rsquo;t be startled if you see a rabbit
swimming here! The park&rsquo;s rodents include the
marsh rice rat and round-tailed muskrat, also at
home in a watery <a class="gloss" href="#g_Environment">environment</a>.</p>
<p>The playful otter, though it may travel long distances
overland, is a famous water-lover. Lucky is the
visitor who sees a family of these large relatives of
the weasel! The otter&rsquo;s smaller cousin, the
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Everglade">everglades</a> mink, is also a denizen of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Marsh">marsh</a> and
a <a class="gloss" href="#g_Predator">predator</a> in the food web; but you are not likely
to see this wary animal.</p>
<p>Raccoons and opossums, adaptable creatures that
they are, live in all the park&rsquo;s environments&mdash;except
in the air and under water. Their diets are as wide-ranging
as their <a class="gloss" href="#g_Habitat">habitat</a>. The raccoon, though it
has a taste for aquatic animals such as fish, frogs,
and crayfish, also consumes small land vertebrates
and various plant foods. The opossum eats virtually
anything in the animal kingdom that it can find and
subdue, as well as a wide variety of plant materials.</p>

<p>South Florida is the last known refuge in the world for a
sub-species of cougar known as the Florida panther.
This large, beautiful cat is on the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Endangered">endangered</a> species
list. Today many groups and individuals are working to
keep this <a class="gloss" href="#g_Predator">predator</a> a part of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Environment">environment</a>. Their
efforts have resulted in methods to assist panther
recovery: lower speed limits and highway culverts and
bridges, to mention only two. With continued assistance,
the panther may remain a part of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Everglade">Everglades</a> for
years to come.</p>
<p>Because it is much more numerous and much less
secretive in its habits, the bobcat is more likely to
be encountered by park visitors than is the cougar.
Keep your eyes alert for this wild feline&mdash;particularly
in the Flamingo area&mdash;and you may have a chance
to observe it closely and at some length (even by
daylight!). Such boldness and such unconcern for
humans are not typical of this species, but seem
to be peculiarities of the bobcats living in the park.
Although bobcats are not known as water lovers,
they are found in all the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Everglade">Everglades</a> environments.
Their apparent liking for life in the park may be
due to an abundance of food and to freedom from
persecution by man and his dogs. Bobcats in
Everglades, if their food habits elsewhere are any
guide, probably live on rodents, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Marsh">marsh</a> rabbits, and
birds, with possibly an occasional fawn.</p>
<p>In Florida Bay and the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Estuary">estuaries</a>, look for the
porpoise, or bottlenosed dolphin, a small member
of the whale order that has endeared itself to
Americans through its antics at marine aquariums
and on television. Watch for it when you are on
a boat trip in the park&rsquo;s marine <a class="gloss" href="#g_Environment">environment</a>.</p>
<p>Much less commonly seen, and much less familiar,
is the timid and very rare manatee. It&rsquo;s probably
the &ldquo;most&rdquo; animal of the park&mdash;the largest (sometimes
over 15 feet long and weighing nearly 1 ton),
the shyest, the strangest, and the homeliest; and
it is probably also the most delicate, for a drop in
water temperatures may kill it. The <a class="gloss" href="#g_Estuary">estuaries</a> of
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Everglade">Everglades</a> National Park are almost the northern
limits of its normal range. But manatees are often
found well north of the park on both coasts in cold
weather, when they swim up rivers to seek the
constant-temperature water discharged by electric
power plants. Despite its size, the manatee is a harmless
creature, being a grazer&mdash;a sort of underwater
cow that is exceptionally vulnerable to motorboats
because of its gentle nature and languid movement.</p>

<p>From the pelican&mdash;whose mouth can hold more than
its belly can&mdash;to the tiny hummingbird, the birds
of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Everglade">Everglades</a> National Park add beauty, amusement,
excitement, and drama to the daily scene. Much
more conspicuous than the park&rsquo;s other animals,
they can be enjoyed with no special effort. But a
pair of binoculars and a field guide will make bird
watching a more rewarding pastime for you.</p>
<p>Many of the park&rsquo;s birds are large and colorful, and
so tolerant of man&rsquo;s presence that you can observe
them closely without the aid of binoculars. The
Anhinga Trail and other sites on or near the main
park road provide ready access to activity by herons
and egrets, cormorants, gallinules, and other
species that feed upon the fish, frogs, and lesser
life of the waters.</p>
<p>The anhinga, after whom the park&rsquo;s most popular
trail is named, is a favorite with visitors. It is also
called water-turkey, probably because of its large
size and long, white-tipped tail feathers. A third
name, snake bird, derives from the anhinga&rsquo;s habit
of swimming almost totally submerged with its
long, snaky neck above the surface. The anhinga
is a skilled fisherman, seeking out its quarry by
swimming underwater. It spears a fish with its
beak, surfaces, tosses the fish into the air, catches it,
and gulps it down head first. During this activity,
the anhinga has gotten soaked to the skin, for,
unlike ducks and many other water birds, it is not
well supplied with oil to keep its plumage dry. So,
following a plunge, the anhinga struggles to the
branch of a shrub or tree, and, spreading its wings,
hangs its feathers out to dry.</p>
<p>The snail kite, one of America&rsquo;s rarest birds,
flies low over the fresh-water <a class="gloss" href="#g_Marsh">marshes</a>, its head
pointed downward, searching for its sole food&mdash;the
Pomacea snail. A sharply hooked beak enables it
to remove the snail from its shell. More striking
in appearance is its cousin, the swallow-tailed kite,
aerial acrobat of the hawk family&mdash;a migrant that
nests in the park in spring and spends the winter
in South America. On long, pointed wings this
handsome bird eats in the air while holding itself in
one place on the wind. In the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mangrove">mangroves</a>, it hunts in
an unusual way: skimming over the trees, it snatches
lizards and other small animals from the topmost
branches. Red-shouldered hawks, often seen
perching on the treetops beside the park road, feed
upon snakes and other small animals. The fish-eating
osprey is another conspicuous resident of
the park, and its bulky nests will be seen when you
take a boat trip into Florida Bay or the mangrove
wilderness. The bald eagle, which, sadly, is no
longer common in North America and may soon
be exterminated because of pesticide pollution of
its fishing waters, is still holding out in the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Everglade">Everglades</a>
region, where 50 or so breeding pairs seem
to be reproducing successfully.</p>

<p>The long-legged wading birds of the heron family
are so numerous and so much alike in appearance
that you will need your bird guide for sure
identification. The waders are interesting to watch,
because of the variety of feeding methods.
Particularly amusing are the antics of the reddish
egret as it hunts small animals in the shallows of
Florida Bay at low tide. It is much unlike other
herons in its manner of hunting: it lurches through
the shallows, dashing to left and right as if drunk,
in pursuit of its prey. This clownish survivor of the
old plume-hunting days exists in Florida in very
limited numbers.</p>
<p>Since about 300 species of birds have been recorded
in the park, this sampling barely suggests the
pleasures awaiting you if you plan to spend some
time playing the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Everglade">Everglades</a> bird-watching game.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<h3 id="c19">Reptiles and Amphibians</h3>
<p><a class="gloss" href="#g_Everglade">Everglades</a>&rsquo; most famous citizen&mdash;the alligator&mdash;is
looked for by all visitors to the park, who may,
however, be unaware that many other kinds of
reptiles and a dozen species of amphibians dwell here.</p>
<p>The American crocodile, less common than the
alligator and restricted to the Florida Bay region,
is a shy and secretive animal seen by few visitors.
Similar in size and appearance to the alligator, it
is distinguished by a narrower snout and a lighter
color. Its <a class="gloss" href="#g_Habitat">habitat</a> overlaps that of the alligator,
which prefers fresh or <a class="gloss" href="#g_BrackishWater">brackish water</a>.</p>
<p>The turtles of the park include terrestrial, fresh-water,
and marine species. Box turtles are often seen
along the roads. The softshell and snapping turtles
live in the fresh-water areas and are often eaten by
alligators. Loggerhead turtles nest on Cape Sable
beaches, otherwise they rarely come ashore. Their
eggs are often discovered and devoured by the
abundant raccoons. But man has been largely responsible
for the loggerhead&rsquo;s increasing rarity.</p>
<p>Although the park has about two dozen species of
snakes, you may not encounter any of them. Most
are harmless&mdash;several species of snakes frequent
the waterways, and it is a mistake to assume that
any water snake you see is a moccasin. Two worth
watching for are the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Everglade">everglades</a> rat snake and the
indigo snake, both handsome and entirely harmless
to man. The former is a constrictor, feeding mostly
on rodents. The indigo is one of our longest snakes&mdash;sometimes
reaching more than 100 inches&mdash;and now
in danger of extinction.</p>
<p>Ordinary caution and alertness when walking on
trails is advisable; but keep in mind that the snakes
are not aggressive, and that as part of the web of
life in the park they are given protection just as
are birds and mammals.</p>
<p>Of those close relatives of snakes, the lizards, the
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">71</span>
Florida anole is most commonly seen. This is the
little reptile sold at circuses as a &ldquo;chameleon&rdquo;; it is
quite unlike the true chameleon of the Old World.
The so-called &ldquo;glass snake&rdquo;&mdash;which got its name
from its defensive maneuver of dropping off its tail
(which is longer than the rest of its body) and from
its snakelike appearance&mdash;is actually a legless
lizard. The lizards, like the smaller snakes, are
primarily insectivorous.</p>
<p>The park&rsquo;s amphibians, too, are quite inconspicuous.
The voices of frogs and toads during the breeding
season, however, are part of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Everglade">Everglades</a>
atmosphere. You will enjoy the nocturnal serenade
at egg-laying time&mdash;and it is quite possible to learn
to identify species by their songs, which are as
distinctive as those of birds.</p>
<p>The green treefrog, with its bell-like, repeated
&ldquo;queenk-queenk-queenk&rdquo; call, is abundant, and
can be seen and heard easily during the breeding
season, particularly at Royal Palm <a class="gloss" href="#g_Hammock">Hammock</a> and
on the Anhinga Trail.</p>
<p>The cold-blooded vertebrates, including fish,
amphibians, and reptiles, play a significant role in
the balance of life in the park, feeding upon each
other and upon lesser animals and in turn being
food for larger <a class="gloss" href="#g_Predator">predators</a> such as herons, hawks,
raccoons, and otters.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<h3 id="c20">Fishes</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Fishing Reserved for the Birds,&rdquo; says the sign at
the beginning of the Anhinga Trail. Actually, the
catching of fish in the fresh waters of the park is an
important activity not only for herons, anhingas,
grebes, and ospreys, but also for raccoons, mink,
turtles, alligators ... and bigger fish. Not surprisingly
in the drowned <a class="gloss" href="#g_Habitat">habitats</a> of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Everglade">Everglades</a>, even
the smallest fish are important in the web of life.</p>
<p>One tiny species, the gambusia, is of special interest
to us. This 2-inch fish is credited with helping
keep down the numbers of mosquitoes by feeding
upon their aquatic larvae. This accounts for its
other name&mdash;mosquito fish&mdash;and for its popularity
with humans. But its services to us are not the
measure of the gambusia&rsquo;s importance, for it is a
link in many food chains in the park&rsquo;s brackish and
fresh-water <a class="gloss" href="#g_Habitat">habitats</a>. Beginning with <a class="gloss" href="#g_Algae">algae</a>, we can
trace one such chain through mosquito larvae,
sunfish, and bass, to end with the alligator. We
can only guess at the extent of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Ecology">ecological</a> effects
of the loss of a single species such as the little
gambusia.</p>
<p>The larger fish of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Everglade">Everglades</a> are the most sought
after. Sport fishermen want to know where to
find and how to recognize the many varieties of
game fish, especially largemouth bass and such
famed salt-water and brackish zone species as
tarpon, snook, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mangrove">mangrove</a> snapper, and barracuda.
Because of its cycles of flood and drought, and the
shifting brackish zones, however, the distribution
and the numbers of fish fluctuate greatly in the
glades and mangrove regions. At times of drought,
the fish concentrations are particularly evident.
In mid- or late winter, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Slough">sloughs</a> that are no longer
deep enough to flow, pools, and other standing
bodies of water will have a myriad of gambusia,
killifish, and minnows. Larger fish seek the
sanctuary of the headwaters of the Harney, Shark,
and Broad Rivers. At such times concentrations of
bass may be so great that the angler may catch his
<span class="pb" id="Page_73">73</span>
daily limit in a few hours. (There are no legal limits
for the herons and &rsquo;gators!)</p>
<p>As water levels continue to fall, salt water intrudes
farther inland; such species as snook and tarpon
move up the now brackish rivers, and may be seen
in the same waters as bluegills and largemouth bass.</p>
<p>In some years water levels drop so severely that
concentrations of fish are too great for the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Habitat">habitat</a>
to support. As the surface water shrinks, the fish
use up the available free oxygen and begin to die.
The largest expire first; the smaller fish seem less
vulnerable to depleted oxygen supply. Even though
many tons of fish may perish in such a die-off, a
few small specimens of each variety survive to
restock the glades when the rains return.</p>
<p>With no cold season when fish must remain dormant,
and with a year-round food supply, bass and sunfish
grow rapidly and reach breeding size before the
next drought.</p>
<p>These fish kills are associated with drought conditions
that occur in the ordinary course of events,
and thus are natural phenomena not to be considered
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Ecology">ecological</a> disasters. But man&rsquo;s violent upsetting
of the drainage patterns of south Florida, through
airport, canal, and highway construction and
other developments, can bring about such drastic
shortages (or even surpluses) of water that irreparable
damage could be done to the ecology of
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Everglade">Everglades</a> aquatic <a class="gloss" href="#g_Community">communities</a>.</p>
<p>While fish watching may not be the exciting sport
that bird watching is, you are the loser if you ignore
this part of the life of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Everglade">Everglades</a>. Fish are so
abundant in the park that no one has to haul them
in on a line to discover them. You can hardly miss
spotting the larger fresh-water forms if you take the
trouble to look down into the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Slough">sloughs</a>, ponds, and
alligator holes.</p>
<p>Identifying the species of fish, however, is more
difficult. The voracious-looking Florida spotted gar
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
is an exception. This important <a class="gloss" href="#g_Predator">predator</a> on smaller
fishes, which is in turn a major item in the diet of
the alligator, is quite easily recognized. Experienced
anglers will spot the largemouthed bass and the
bluegill sunfish. You&rsquo;ll see these and others as you
walk on the Anhinga Trail boardwalk.</p>
<p>As you watch alligators and other native <a class="gloss" href="#g_Everglade">Everglades</a>
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Predator">predators</a>, you may get an inkling of how important
in the web of life are the prolific fish populations
of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Slough">sloughs</a>, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Marsh">marshes</a>, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Swamp">swamps</a>, and offshore
waters of the park.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<h3 id="c21">Animals without Backbones</h3>
<p>Insects are the most noticeable of the park&rsquo;s
invertebrates. (At times you may find your can of
repellent as important as your shoes!) In all the
fresh-water and brackish environments, insects and
their larvae are important links in the food chains&mdash;at
the beginning as primary consumers of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Algae">algae</a> and
other plant material, and farther along as <a class="gloss" href="#g_Predator">predators</a>,
mostly on other insects. Some insects are parasites
on the park&rsquo;s warmblooded animals (including you).</p>
<p>The invertebrates most sought by visitors are
molluscs&mdash;or rather, their shells. You may find a
few on the beach at Cape Sable, but don&rsquo;t expect
to find the park a productive shelling area. Stick
to marine shells&mdash;<i>dead</i> ones. You cannot collect
the fresh-water molluscs. Also protected are the
tree snails of jungle <a class="gloss" href="#g_Hammock">hammocks</a>. Famed for their
beauty, these snails of the genus <i>Liguus</i>, which
grow to as much as 2&frac12; inches in diameter, feed
upon the lichens growing on certain hammock
trees. Look for them&mdash;but leave them undisturbed,
for they are a part of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Community">community</a>, protected just
as are the park&rsquo;s royal palms and its alligators.</p>

<h2 id="c22"><span class="small">INDIANS OF THE <a class="gloss" href="#g_Everglade">EVERGLADES</a></span></h2>
<p>Your first awareness of the south Florida Indians
will probably come during a trip along the Tamiami
Trail (U.S. 41, the cross-State highway just north
of the park). You will notice clusters of Indian
homes close to the road. Some are built on stilts,
are thatched with palm fronds, and are open-sided
so that no walls hamper the flow of cooling breezes.
Many of the glades Indians prefer to live as their
ancestors did some 150 years ago when they were
newcomers to the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Everglade">everglades</a>. Others have adopted
the white man&rsquo;s dwellings (as well as his
occupations).</p>
<p>The Indians of south Florida&mdash;Miccosukees,
sometimes called &ldquo;Trail Indians&rdquo;; and Muskogees,
the &ldquo;Cow Creek Seminoles&rdquo;&mdash;are separate tribes,
not sharing a common language. Today no Indians
live inside the park boundaries.</p>
<p>The Indians arrived in Spanish Florida after the
American Revolution. Many Creeks of Georgia and
Alabama, crowded by the aggressive white man,
fled south to the peninsula. They first settled in
north Florida; when Florida became a State in 1845
they had to retreat farther south. Driven into the
interior during the Seminole War of 1835, they
eventually settled in the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Everglade">everglades</a>, where deer,
fish, and fruit were available. Though their territory
is now much more limited, they still retain much of
their independent spirit, and have never signed a
peace treaty with the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>Many earn their living operating air boats, as
proprietors and employees of roadside businesses,
and in a variety of jobs on farms and in cities. The
women create distinctive handicraft items, which
find a ready market with tourists.</p>
<p>No one is certain when the first Indians&mdash;the Calusas
and Tequestas&mdash;appeared in south Florida; it may
have been more than 2,000 years ago. Even more
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">78</span>
than today&rsquo;s glades Indians, these coastal Indians
lived with the rhythm of river and tides, rain and
drought. Hunting, fishing, and gathering of shellfish
were their means of existence. We have learned
this much of their life from artifacts unearthed from
the many Indian mounds or washed up along the
beaches. They lived on huge shell mounds, made
pottery, used sharks&rsquo; teeth to make saws, and
fashioned other tools from conch shells. They even
built impoundments for fish&mdash;a few remains of these
can be seen today. They were ingenious hunters.
(Ponce de Le&oacute;n and his Spanish explorer-marauders
were said to have been turned back from the
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Everglade">everglades</a> by the deadly arrows these Indians
fashioned from rushes.)</p>
<div class="img" id="fig67">
<img src="images/i033.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="590" />
<p class="pcap"></p>
</div>
<p>Following the arrival of the Spanish, these early
Indians disappeared from the scene. They were
apparently wiped out, destroyed by the white man&rsquo;s
diseases as much as by his aggression; but some
<span class="pb" id="Page_79">79</span>
may have escaped to Cuba. Perhaps a handful of
them were still in the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Everglade">everglades</a> when the Creeks
came down from the north in 1835, and were
absorbed into the new tribe. Their known history
ends here.</p>
<p>Proud, independent, and ingenious in wresting a
living from the land and the water, the Indians knew
how to live with nature. Unlike the white man, they
fitted into the plant-and-animal <a class="gloss" href="#g_Community">communities</a>.
Today these communities have been severely disrupted.
In the few decades that the white man has
been &ldquo;developing&rdquo; the region, he has broken every
chain of life described in this book.</p>
<p>Alligator populations have been much reduced in
south Florida; their chief prey, the garfish, has in
some places become so numerous as to constitute a
nuisance (most of all to the fresh-water anglers,
some of whom had a hand in the killing of alligators).
The pattern of waterflow over the glades, through
the cypress <a class="gloss" href="#g_Swamp">swamps</a>, and into the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mangrove">mangrove</a>
wilderness has been altered by highways and canals.
Much of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Habitat">habitat</a> has been wiped out by construction
of homes and factories and by farming
operations. An increasingly alarming development
is the pollution of glades waters by agricultural
chemicals.</p>
<p>Only through complete understanding of this fragile,
unique subtropical world can man reverse the
destructive trend. Only through carefully applied
protective and management practices can we make
progress toward restoring to the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Everglade">Everglades</a> some
of its lost splendor.</p>

<h3 id="c24">Glossary</h3>
<p><b id="g_Algae">ALGAE</b>: (pronounced &ldquo;AL-jee&rdquo;) A group of plants (singular:
ALGA, pronounced &ldquo;AL-ga&rdquo;), one-celled or many-celled, having
chlorophyll, without roots, and living in damp places or in
water.</p>
<p><b id="g_BrackishWater">BRACKISH WATER</b>: Mixed fresh and salt water. Many species
of plants and animals of marine and fresh-water <a class="gloss" href="#g_Habitat">habitats</a>
are adapted to life in <a class="gloss" href="#g_Estuary">estuaries</a> and coastal <a class="gloss" href="#g_Swamp">swamps</a> and
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Marsh">marshes</a>, where the water varies greatly in degree of salinity.
Some animal species can be found in all three habitats.</p>
<p><b id="g_Bromeliad">BROMELIAD</b>: A plant of the pineapple family. Many <a class="gloss" href="#g_Bromeliad">bromeliads</a>
are air plants, growing (not parasitically) on the trunks
and branches of other plants, or even, as in the case of
&ldquo;Spanish moss,&rdquo; on telephone wires.</p>
<p><b id="g_Community">COMMUNITY</b>: The living part of the ecosystem; an assemblage
of plants and animals living in a particular area or physical
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Habitat">habitat</a>. It can be as small as a decaying log, with its
variety of mosses, insect larvae, burrowing beetles, ants, etc.;
or as large as a forest of hundreds of square miles.</p>
<p><b id="g_DeciduousTrees">DECIDUOUS TREES</b>: Trees that shed their leaves annually.
Most <a class="gloss" href="#g_HardwoodTrees">hardwood trees</a> are deciduous; some conifers, such as
larches and baldcypresses, are deciduous.</p>
<p><b id="g_Ecology">ECOLOGY</b>: The study of the relationship of living things to
one another and to their physical <a class="gloss" href="#g_Environment">environment</a>.</p>
<p><b id="g_Endangered">ENDANGERED</b>: A species of plant or animal that, throughout
all or a significant portion of its range, is in danger of
extinction.</p>
<p><b id="g_Environment">ENVIRONMENT</b>: All the external conditions, such as soil,
water, air, and organisms, surrounding a living thing.</p>
<p><b id="g_Estivation">ESTIVATION</b>: A prolonged dormant or sleeplike state that
enables an animal to survive the summer in a hot climate. As
in hibernation, breathing and heartbeat slow down, and the
animal neither eats nor drinks.</p>
<p><b id="g_Estuary">ESTUARY</b>: The portion of a river or coastal wetland affected
by the rise and fall of the tide, containing a graded
mixture of fresh and salt water.</p>
<p><b id="g_Everglade">EVERGLADE</b>: A tract of marshy land covered in places with
tall grasses. (In this book, &ldquo;the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Everglade">everglades</a>&rdquo; refers to the river
of grass; &ldquo;Everglades&rdquo; refers to the park, which contains
other <a class="gloss" href="#g_Habitat">habitats</a> besides everglades.)</p>
<p><b id="g_Exotic">EXOTIC</b>: A foreign plant or animal that has been introduced,
intentionally or unintentionally, into a new area.</p>
<p><b id="g_FoodChain">FOOD CHAIN</b>: A series of plants and animals linked by their
food relationships, beginning with a green plant and ending
with a <a class="gloss" href="#g_Predator">predator</a>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p><b id="g_Habitat">HABITAT</b>: The place where an organism lives; the immediate
surroundings, living and unliving, of an organism. The
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Habitat">habitat</a> of the pine warbler is the pinelands; the habitat of an
internal parasite of this bird is the body of the warbler.</p>
<p><b id="g_Hammock">HAMMOCK</b>: A dense growth of broad-leaved trees on a
slightly elevated area, not wet enough to be a <a class="gloss" href="#g_Swamp">swamp</a>. In the
park, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Hammock">hammocks</a> are surrounded either by pineland or by
marshland (glades).</p>
<p><b id="g_HardwoodTrees">HARDWOOD TREES</b>: Trees with broad leaves (as opposed
to conebearing trees, which have needles or scales). Most
<a class="gloss" href="#g_HardwoodTrees">hardwood trees</a> are deciduous, though many in south Florida
retain their leaves throughout the year.</p>
<p><b id="g_Key">KEY</b>: A reef or low-lying island. In south Florida, the term
&ldquo;<a class="gloss" href="#g_Key">key</a>&rdquo; is often also applied to <a class="gloss" href="#g_Hammock">hammocks</a> or pinelands, which
occupy areas where the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Limestone">limestone</a> is raised above the surrounding
wetlands.</p>
<p><b id="g_Limestone">LIMESTONE</b>: A sedimentary rock derived from the shells
and skeletons of animals deposited in seas, and consisting
mostly of calcium carbonate. Soluble in water having a slight
degree of acidity, it is often characterized by caverns and, in
the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Everglade">everglades</a>, by a very pitted surface. The rock underlying
most of the park is the Miami O&ouml;lite (pronounced OH-uh-lite),
formed during a recent glacial period. O&ouml;litic <a class="gloss" href="#g_Limestone">limestone</a>
is composed of tiny round concretions, only indirectly derived
from marine shells.</p>
<p><b id="g_Mangrove">MANGROVE</b>: Any of a group of tropical or subtropical trees,
growing in <a class="gloss" href="#g_Estuary">estuaries</a> and other low-lying coastal areas, usually
producing aerial roots or prop roots and often forming
dense growths over a large area. In south Florida there are
four species, belonging to three different families.</p>
<p><b id="g_Marsh">MARSH</b>: A wetland, salt or fresh, where few if any trees
and shrubs grow, characterized by grasses and sedges; in
fresh-water <a class="gloss" href="#g_Marsh">marshes</a>, cattails are common.</p>
<p><b id="g_Marl">MARL</b>: In this book, used in the sense of a deposit of mixed
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Limestone">limestone</a> and smaller amounts of clay; south Florida marls
are sometimes called lime muds.</p>
<p><b id="g_Peat">PEAT</b>: Partly decayed, moisture-absorbing plant matter accumulated
in bogs, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Swamp">swamps</a>, etc.</p>
<p><b id="g_Predator">PREDATOR</b>: An animal that lives by capturing other animals
for food.</p>
<p><b id="g_Slough">SLOUGH</b>: A channel of slow-moving water in coastal marshland.
The Shark River <a class="gloss" href="#g_Slough">Slough</a> and Taylor Slough are the main
channels where the glades water flows in the park. Generally
remaining as reservoirs of water when the glades dry in
the rainless season, they are important to survival of aquatic
animals.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p><b id="g_Swamp">SWAMP</b>: Wetland characterized by shrubs or trees such as
maples, gums, baldcypresses, and, in south Florida coast
areas, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mangrove">mangroves</a>. Fresh-water <a class="gloss" href="#g_Swamp">swamps</a> are usually not covered
by water the year around.</p>
<p><b id="g_Threatened">THREATENED</b>: A species still present in its range but that,
without significant changes in conditions, is capable of becoming
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Endangered">endangered</a>.</p>
<p><b id="g_TreeIsland">TREE ISLAND</b>: An island of trees, shrubs, and herbaceous
plants growing on an elevation, in a depression, or at the
same level as the surrounding glades. Includes <a class="gloss" href="#g_Hammock">hammocks</a>,
willow heads, cypress heads, and bayheads.</p>

<h3 id="c28">Checklist of Birds</h3>
<p>This is a complete list of the birds known in the
park&mdash;347 species as of June 1, 1985&mdash;along with a
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Key">key</a> indicating the abundance and seasonal occurrence
of each species. As noted in this list many birds are
known in the park from only a few sightings. A few are
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Exotic">exotic</a> birds that have escaped captivity. Species considered
exotic to <a class="gloss" href="#g_Everglade">Everglades</a> Park are marked with an
asterisk (*). Users can contribute to updating future lists
by carefully recording details of their observations of
less common species and reporting that information to
park personnel. For purposes of this listing the seasons
are as follows:</p>
<dl class="undent"><dt>Spring: March 1 to May 31</dt>
<dt>Summer: June 1 to July 31</dt>
<dt>Fall: August 1 to November 15</dt>

<h3 id="c30">Checklist of Trees and Tree-like Plants</h3>
<p>A tree is defined here as a woody plant at least 12 feet
high with a single trunk 2 inches or more in diameter at
breast height. A tree-like plant is one with the general
shape and size of a tree, but one which is not woody or
otherwise fails to meet the definition. The arrangement
of families is generally the same as that of Small&rsquo;s
<i>Manual of Southeastern Flora</i> (1933) and Long and
Lakela&rsquo;s <i>A Flora of Tropical Florida</i> (1971). Genera and
species are listed alphabetically in each family. Nomenclature
follows Avery and Loope, <i>Plants of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Everglade">Everglades</a>
National Park: A Preliminary Checklist of Vascular
Plants</i> (1983). In the checklist, the introduced species
are followed by a symbol, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Key">key</a> below, that describes the
plants&rsquo; success in the Everglades. Native plants list only
their name.</p>

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting

works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily

you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it

  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the

or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
